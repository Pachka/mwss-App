## Surveillance and control measures considered
***
### Isolation/contact restrictions

The risk of transmission during contacts with patients detected as infected is considered null.

### Random tests at regular intervals

For patients, random testing is implemented every week in 75% of patients with no vaccination or infection history, 50% of patients with old vaccination or infection history and 10% of patients with recent vaccination or infection history.
For healthcare workers, random testing is implemented every two weeks in 75% of healthcare workers with no vaccination or infection history, 50% of healthcare workers with old vaccination or infection history and 20% of healthcare workers with recent vaccination or infection history.

The model further assumes that a healthcare worker will take sick leave with 100% probability if he develops severe symptoms, 30% probability if he develops mild symptoms but is not tested or tested negative, and 50% probability if he is tested positive.

Note that the model considers that a tested individual will not be tested again before a minimal duration fixed as the duration of the disease (eg 10 days for covid).

### Test at patient admission
Before admission, new patients undergo a clinical examination, during which they can be tested. Symptomatic patients are always tested, and among asymptomatic or susceptible patients: 75% of patients with no vaccination or infection history, 50% of patients with old vaccination or infection history and 25% of patients with recent vaccination or infection history will undergo a test. The model considers 2 contacts of 10min with the professional in charge of admission and no contact with other patients during the admission process.
