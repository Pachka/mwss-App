## Objective
Dynamic epidemiological modeling is a powerful tool to analyze the risk of pathogen persistence and spread, following an introduction in a population, as well as predicting the impact of surveillance and control strategies. In small populations such as patients and healthcare workers in healthcare settings, heterogeneity and stochasticity play fundamental roles due to the risk of super-spreading events or epidemic extinction. Epidemic models of hospital-acquired infections generally consider a unique homogeneous population and do not account for the organizational or multi-ward structure, hindering the capacity of models to capture nosocomial spread processes accurately. 

We use here a network-structured model to simulate disease spreading across wards inside a healthcare facility and test the efficacy of intervention strategies on disease control. 

## Methods
### Hospital structure and population

```{r, results='asis'}
if(!is.null(params$clustering))
cat('
This report presents synthetic results of', length(params$trajmwss), 'simulations run for an',  params$clustering, 'hospital structure including', length(params$ward_names), 'wards distributed over five buildings, and connected through healthcare workers (the structure is detailed in the following figure and table).')

if(is.null(params$clustering))
cat('
This report presents synthetic results of', length(params$trajmwss), 'simulations run for an hospital structure including', length(params$ward_names), 'wards distributed over five buildings, and connected through healthcare workers (the structure is detailed in the following figure and table).')
```

      plot_connectivity(

        verbose = FALSE
      ) 
   }

  df <- data.frame(Number_of_patients = params$pop_size_P,
                 Number_of_healthcare_workers = params$pop_size_H,

### Epidemiology: pathogen and immunity level
We simulate the diffusion of  ``r params$disease`` in a fully susceptible population (no immunity).

<!-- in a population with **no/low/high/heterogeneous** immunity/ -->

<!-- A couple of key parameters to include: -->
<!-- 1. Baseline transmissible (R0) -->
The baseline basic reproduction number (R0) considered was ``r if(params$disease == "Covid") 13 else if(params$disease == "Influenza") 1.3   # params$gdata["pconta"]*(8 * (30 / 60 / 24) * params$gdata["prev"]/params$gdata["hinc"])``.

<!-- 2. Severity (probability of developing (severe) symptoms) -->
The severity (probability of developing severe symptoms) considered is ``r params$gdata["psevPNI"]`` for individuals without any immunity (neither vaccinated nor recovered), ``r params$gdata["psevPLI"]`` for individuals with a low immunity level (considering either an old vaccine injection or recovery), and ``r params$gdata["psevPHI"]`` for individuals with a high immunity level (considering either a recent vaccine injection or recovery).

<!-- 3. Fraction of HCW and PATIENTS with low/high immunity. -->



<!-- A quick recap of the interventions assumed.  -->
### Intervention strategies
```{asis, echo = !is.null(params$scenarios)}
In this simulation, the following intervention strategies were implemented.
```

<!-- 1. confinement/contact restriction to detected patients -->

```{asis, echo = "ISO" %in% params$scenarios}
#### Confinement/contact restriction to detected patients
The risk of transmission during contacts with patients detected as infected is considered null.
```
<!-- 2. implementation of a screening area at patient admission including contact restriction/clinical examination/test -->
```{asis, echo = "SA" %in% params$scenarios}

#### Implementation of a screening area at patient admission including contact restriction, clinical examination and test
Before admission, new patients undergo a clinical examination, during which they can be tested. Symptomatic patients are always tested, and among asymptomatic or susceptible patients: 75% of patients with no vaccination or infection history, 50% of patients with old vaccination or infection history and 25% of patients with recent vaccination or infection history will undergo a test. The model considers 2 contacts of 10min with the professional in charge of admission and no contact with other patients during the admission process.
```
<!-- 3. screening of patients by implementation of tests on a random subset of patient population at regular intervals -->
```{asis, echo = "testPat" %in% params$scenarios}

#### Screening of patients by implementation of tests on a random subset of patient population at regular intervals
For patients, random testing is implemented every week in 75% of patients with no vaccination or infection history, 50% of patients with old vaccination or infection history and 10% of patients with recent vaccination or infection history.

Note that the model considers that a tested individual will not be tested again before a minimal duration fixed as the duration of the disease (eg 10 days for covid).

```
<!-- 4. screening of healthcare workers by implementation of tests on a random subset of healthcare worker population at regular intervals -->
```{asis, echo = "testProf" %in% params$scenarios}

#### Screening of healthcare workers by implementation of tests on a random subset of healthcare worker population at regular intervals
For healthcare workers, random testing is implemented every two weeks in 75% of healthcare workers with no vaccination or infection history, 50% of healthcare workers with old vaccination or infection history and 20% of healthcare workers with recent vaccination or infection history.

The model further assumes that a healthcare worker will take sick leave with 100% probability if he develops severe symptoms, 30% probability if he develops mild symptoms but is not tested or tested negative, and 50% probability if he is tested positive.

Note that the model considers that a tested individual will not be tested again before a minimal duration fixed as the duration of the disease (eg 10 days for covid).
```

```{asis, echo = is.null(params$scenarios)}
No intervention strategy was implemented. The results presented here consider a baseline scenario without any interventions.
```


<!-- A quick recap of the importation level assumed.  -->
### Level of importation


```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
if (params$gdata[['hinc']] == 0) {cat(paste0('In this simulation, no regular importation was implemented, incidence was set at 0. The simulations only considered an index case in ward ', params$EPIstate$ward, '.')     
)}


if (params$gdata[['hinc']] == 50/100000) {cat('In this simulation, the initial population is considered as fully susceptible. A low level of importation was considered with the incidence set at 50 cases per 100,000 persons in the incoming population.'  
)}

if (params$gdata[['hinc']] == 185/100000) {cat('In this simulation, the initial population is considered as fully susceptible. A high level of importation was considered with the incidence set at 185 cases per 100,000 persons in the incoming population.'

## Modelling project:
Supported by the D√©partement d‚Äôinformation m√©dicale of the Centre hospitalier Guillaume R√©gnier (Rennes, France), a simulation modeling project was undertaken during the 2020 pandemic to evaluate the effect of infection control protocols on SARS-CoV-2 spread in french long-term care facilities. The modeling was carried out by the French Pasteur Institute, the French Conservatoire national des Arts et m√©tiers, and the French University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, in collaboration with the Department of Disease Control and Epidemiology of the National Veterinary Institute of Sweden. Epidemiological simulations are performed using R-based packages: mwss and SimInf. 

Results presented in this report were generated using the open source R package ‚ÄòMWSS‚Äô which uses the Gillespie algorithm, implemented with mwss R-package. 

Note that simulations were run locally and, to deal with data confidentiality challenges, the parameters and simulations were not saved on our servers.
